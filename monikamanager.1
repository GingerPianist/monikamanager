.SH OPTIONS

    --help                  prints fast help menu and exits the script
    --scan PATH             scans given PATH and writes filenames, file hashes, file sizes to .mm databases. Each .mm file is located 				     in every directory in the scanned path
    --find-duplicates PATH  finds duplicates in the subtree beginning in the PATH. It is achieved by going through the prevoiusly 			     generated .mm files
    --force                 force update .mm files, regardless of changes in them
    --ranking PATH NUMBER   displays a list of NUMBER of filenames of the biggest files in 				     the specified PATH and the whole subtree
    
    
	Script creates .mm database files in every directory that is scans. Each .mm file consists of the list of: filenames-modificationTime-fileHash-fileSize. In order to properly find duplicates or list of biggest files it is obligatory to firstly perform the --scan PATH operation (which creates the .mm files) and then it is possible to perform the rest of the possible operations.
